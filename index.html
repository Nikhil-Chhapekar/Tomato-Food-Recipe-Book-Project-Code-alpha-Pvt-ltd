                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p><br>Noodles Preparation:

                        Boil 1 cup of water in a pan. Once it starts boiling, add the Maggi noodles and cook until they

                        <br>Vegetable Preparation:

                        In a separate pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they
                        become translucent.

                        Add ginger-garlic paste (if using) and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

                        Add the mixed vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes until they become slightly tender.

                        Add finely chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft.

                        minutes.
                        <br>Combine Noodles and Vegetables:

                        Add the boiled Maggi noodles to the vegetable mixture. Mix everything well, ensuring the noodles
                        are coated with the spices.
                        <br>Garnish and Serve:

                        Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.

                        Serve hot, optionally with lemon wedges on the side.
                        <br>In a wide pan, melt the butter or margarine. Add the onions. Cook until onions are soft.
                        <br>Put-in the ginger and cook for 2 minutes
                        <br>Add the chicken liver. Crush the chicken liver while cooking it in the pan.
                        <br>Add the chopped pig ears and pork belly. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes
                        <br>Put-in the soy sauce, garlic powder, and chili. Mix well

                        <br>Transfer to a serving plate. Top with chopped green onions and raw egg.

                    <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                    <p>

                        1 cup thick poha (flattened rice)<br>
                        1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped<br>
                        1 medium-sized potato, peeled and diced<br>
                        1/2 cup green peas (fresh or frozen)<br>
                        1-2 green chilies, finely chopped<br>
                        1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds<br>
                        1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds<br>
                        8-10 curry leaves<br>
                        1/4 cup peanuts<br>
                        1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
                        Salt to taste<br>
                        1 tablespoon oil<br>
                        Fresh coriander leaves for garnishing<br>
                        Lemon wedges for serving


                    </p>
                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p>1. Rinse the poha under running water for a minute. Drain excess water and set it aside. Let it
                        sit for about 5-10 minutes to soften.<br>
                        2. In a pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Allow them to
                        splutter.<br>
                        Add peanuts and sauté until they turn golden brown.<br>
                        Add curry leaves, chopped green chilies, and onions. Sauté until onions become translucent.<br>
                        Add diced potatoes and cook until they are slightly tender. If needed, sprinkle some water and
                        cover the pan to cook the potatoes faster.<br>
                        Add green peas and cook for another 2-3 minutes.<br>
                        3. Once the vegetables are cooked, add the soaked and softened poha to the pan.<br>
                        Add turmeric powder and salt. Mix everything gently to combine. Cook for an additional 3-5
                        minutes on low heat.<br>
                        4. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.<br>
                        5. Serve hot with a side of lemon wedges. Poha is often enjoyed with sev, grated coconut, or a
                        dollop of yogurt.

                    <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                        <br>1 tsp sunflower oil

                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat
                        the eggs lightly with a fork.
                        2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3
                        eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking
                        the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
                        3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently
                        lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow
                        to the edge of the pan.
                        4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to
                        set. Cook for a few more seconds
                        5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone
                        spatula.

                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p>1. **Roast Semolina:**
                        <br>- Heat a pan over medium heat and dry roast the semolina until it turns light brown and
                        gives a nutty aroma. Keep stirring to avoid burning. Once done, remove it from the pan and set
                        aside.

                        2. **Prepare Tempering:**
                        <br>- In the same pan, heat oil or ghee. Add mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, and cumin
                        seeds. Allow them to splutter.

                        3. **Saute Aromatics:**
                        <br>- Add chopped ginger and green chili. Saute for a minute until the raw smell disappears.

                        4. **Add Vegetables:**
                        <br>- Add chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent. Add carrots, green peas, and
                        continue to sauté for another 2-3 minutes.

                        5. **Cook Semolina:**
                        <br>- Add the roasted semolina to the pan. Mix well to coat the semolina with the tempered
                        ingredients and vegetables.

                        6. **Season and Add Water:**
                        <br>- Add turmeric powder, salt, and water to the pan. Stir continuously to avoid lumps. Bring
                        it to a boil.

                        7. **Simmer and Cover:**
                        <br>- Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes or until the upma
                        is cooked and the water is absorbed.

                        8. **Garnish and Serve:**
                        <br>- Once cooked, fluff the upma with a fork. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot
                        with lemon wedges if desired.

                        pastry filled with a savory mixture of spiced potatoes, peas, and sometimes other vegetables.
                        The dough is made from all-purpose flour, while the filling is seasoned with aromatic spices
                        such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala. These flavorful parcels are deep-fried until golden
                        brown, resulting in a delicious, crunchy exterior with a warm and flavorful interior. Samosas
                        are often served with chutney or sauce and are enjoyed as a tasty appetizer or snack.

                    <p>For the Dough:

                        2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)<br>
                        1/4 cup oil<br>

                        A pinch of salt<br>
                        For the Filling:

                        2 cups boiled and mashed potatoes<br>
                        1 cup boiled and chopped mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, and green beans work well)<br>
                        1 finely chopped onion<br>
                        1 teaspoon grated ginger<br>
                        1 teaspoon minced garlic<br>
                        1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)<br>
                        1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br>
                        1 teaspoon coriander powder<br>
                        1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
                        1/2 teaspoon garam masala<br>
                        Salt, to taste<br>
                        Fresh coriander leaves, chopped<br>
                        Oil for frying<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p>Prepare the Dough:

                        In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, and oil.<br>
                        Gradually add water and knead the mixture to form a smooth and stiff dough.<br>
                        Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.<br>
                        Prepare the Filling:

                        Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.<br>
                        Add chopped onions, ginger, and garlic. Sauté until the onions become translucent.<br>
                        Add green chilies and stir for a minute.<br>
                        Add boiled and mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, coriander powder, turmeric powder, garam
                        masala, and salt. Mix well.<br>
                        Cook the filling for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>
                        Add chopped coriander leaves, mix, and let the filling cool.<br>
                        Shape and Fill the Samosas:

                        Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls.<br>
                        Roll each ball into a thin oval or round shape.<br>
                        Cut the rolled dough in half to form two semi-circles.<br>
                        Create a cone shape by folding each semi-circle and sealing the edges with water.<br>
                        Fill the cone with the prepared potato and vegetable filling, ensuring it's not overfilled.<br>
                        Seal the open edge of the cone to form a triangular samosa.<br>
                        Frying the Samosas:

                        Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat for frying.<br>
                        Once the oil is hot, gently slide the prepared samosas into the oil.<br>
                        Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy.<br>
                        Remove the samosas and place them on a paper towel to absorb excess oil.<br>
                        Serve:

                        Serve the samosas hot with mint chutney or tamarind sauce.<br>

                        <br>1 tspn of pepper

                        <br>1 Egg

                    </p>
                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken
                        breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the
                        chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                        <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which
                        should then be set aside.
                        <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should
                        be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                        <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat
                        until they are crisp and golden brown.
                        <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken,
                        and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted.
                        If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.

                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p>For the Vegetable Balls:

                        In a bowl, combine finely chopped mixed vegetables, all-purpose flour, cornflour, ginger-garlic
                        paste, soy sauce, salt, and black pepper powder.<br>
                        Mix well to form a thick batter. If the mixture is too dry, you can add a little water.<br>
                        Heat oil in a pan for deep frying. Take small portions of the mixture and shape them into small
                        balls.<br>
                        Fry the vegetable balls until they turn golden brown. Remove and drain excess oil on a paper
                        towel.<br>
                        For the Manchurian Sauce:

                        Heat oil in a pan. Add chopped garlic and ginger, sauté for a minute.<br>
                        Add chopped spring onions (white part) and bell peppers. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until they are
                        slightly tender but still crisp.<br>
                        Add soy sauce, chili sauce, tomato ketchup, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Mix well.<br>
                        In a small bowl, mix cornflour with water to make a smooth paste. Add this paste to the pan to
                        thicken the sauce. Stir continuously to avoid lumps.<br>
                        Once the sauce thickens, add the fried vegetable balls. Toss the balls in the sauce until they
                        are well coated.<br>
                        Garnish with chopped spring onion greens.<br>

                    <p class="meal-descript-about">Gulab Jamun is a beloved Indian dessert renowned for its irresistible
                        sweetness and soft texture. These delectable, round dumplings are made from a combination of
                        milk powder, flour, and ghee, forming a dough that is shaped into small balls and deep-fried to
                        a golden brown hue. After frying, they are soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup infused with
                        cardamom and sometimes saffron, allowing the Gulab Jamuns to absorb the sweetness and become
                        delightfully moist. Often adorned with chopped nuts, these syrup-soaked treats are a cherished
                        indulgence at festive occasions and celebrations.

                    <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                    <p>Ingredients:

                        1 cup milk powder<br>
                        1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)<br>
                        1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)<br>
                        2-3 tablespoons milk (as needed)<br>
                        A pinch of baking soda<br>
                        Oil or ghee for frying.<br>
                        For the Sugar Syrup:

                        1 cup sugar<br>
                        1/2 cup water<br>
                        1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder<br>
                        A few strands of saffron (optional)<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p><br>For the Gulab Jamun:

                        In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, ghee, and baking soda.<br>
                        Gradually add milk and knead the mixture into a soft and smooth dough. If needed, add more
                        milk.<br>
                        Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into round balls, ensuring they are smooth
                        and crack-free.<br>
                        Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Fry the gulab jamun balls until they turn golden
                        brown, then remove and drain excess oil on a paper towel.<br>
                        For the Sugar Syrup:

                        In a separate pan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup. Bring it to a boil, stirring
                        until the sugar dissolves.<br>
                        Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using). Simmer the syrup for a few minutes until it
                        slightly thickens.<br>
                        Assembling:

                        Allow the fried gulab jamun balls to cool slightly before adding them to the warm sugar
                        syrup.<br>
                        Let the gulab jamuns soak in the syrup for at least a few hours to absorb the sweetness.<br>
                        Garnish with chopped nuts if desired.<br>

                    <p class="meal-descript-about">Rasgulla is a popular and delightful Indian dessert known for its
                        spongy texture and sweet taste. Made from fresh cottage cheese (chhena), the cheese balls are
                        gently cooked in a sugar syrup until they absorb the sweetness and become light and airy.
                        Rasgullas are often served chilled, making them a refreshing and beloved treat, especially
                        during festivals and celebrations. This classic dessert is cherished for its simplicity and the
                        burst of sweetness it brings to the palate

                <div class="meal-instruct">
                    <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                    <p>1 liter full-fat milk<br>
                        2 tablespoons lemon juice or white vinegar<br>
                        1 cup sugar<br>
                        4 cups water<br>
                        A pinch of cardamom powder (optional)<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                    <p>Prepare the Chhena (Cottage Cheese):

                        Boil the milk in a large pot.
                        Add lemon juice or vinegar to the boiling milk to curdle it.
                        Once the milk has curdled, strain the whey using a muslin cloth to obtain the chhena (cottage
                        cheese).
                        Rinse the chhena under cold water to remove the lemony flavor.
                        Knead the Chhena:

                        Knead the chhena on a clean surface for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and soft.
                        Shape into Balls:

                        Divide the chhena into small portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls.
                        Prepare the Sugar Syrup:

                        In a wide pan, mix sugar and water to make a sugar syrup.
                        Bring the syrup to a boil and then simmer.
                        Cook the Rasgullas:

                        Gently add the chhena balls to the simmering sugar syrup.
                        Cover the pan and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the rasgullas are soft, spongy, and doubled
                        in size.
                        Cool and Serve:

                        Let the rasgullas cool to room temperature.
                        Optionally, sprinkle a pinch of cardamom powder on top for flavor.
                        Chill (optional):

                        For a refreshing touch, refrigerate the rasgullas before serving.
